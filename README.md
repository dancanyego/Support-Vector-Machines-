# Support-Vector-Machines-
Just an Intuition behind SVM that analyze data and Recognize Patterns
This repository contains the implementation and examples of Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide and code samples that will help you understand and utilize SVMs effectively for binary classification problems.

## What is Support Vector Machines?

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It is widely used in various domains such as image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics. SVM aims to find an optimal hyperplane that separates the data points into different classes while maximizing the margin between the classes.

## Repository Structure

- `SampleProject.ipynb/`: This directory contains the source code for SVM implementation on the pulsar dataset.
- `breast_cancer.ipynb/`: This directory contains sample source code on the breast cancer dataset that comes preloaded that can be used to train and test SVM models.
- `iris_flower/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed examples of using SVM for different classification and regression tasks using the famous iris flower dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with Support Vector Machines, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dancanyego/Support-Vector-Machines.git
   ```
   

2. Explore the `[SampleProject]/` directory to understand how to use SVM for various tasks. The Jupyter notebooks provide step-by-step explanations and code snippets Using The pulsar dataset from Kaggle.

3. Experiment with different datasets available in the repository. You can use these datasets to train and evaluate SVM models.

4. Feel free to modify and extend the code  according to your requirements. You can customize the SVM implementation or create new utility functions to enhance the functionality.
